# 🏫 Enrollment System — ABAKADA University

## 📖 Project Overview
This **Enrollment System** was developed as part of our **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** subject. The system aims to modernize and streamline the manual enrollment process of **ABAKADA University**, a private institution that currently faces slow, error-prone, and paper-based enrollment procedures.

To address these issues, our team at **ABC Software Company** designed and developed a **Java-based Enrollment System** with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** connected to a **MySQL database**. The system ensures faster transactions, better data accuracy, and improved record management for students and staff.
